   <h2>About Us</h2>

      Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations, and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.

      Physical activity has many immediate and long-term benefits.

      Physical activity helps you immediately feel better, function better, and sleep better.

      Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity gain some health benefits.

      Immediate benefits
      By age
      Graphics show the health benefits for children,adults, and adults 65 and olderin one page.
      Some benefits of physical activity for brain health happen right after a session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Benefits include improved thinking or cognition for children 6 to 13 and reduced short-term feelings of anxiety for adults. Regular physical activity can help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp as you age. It can also reduce your risk of depression and anxiety and help you sleep better.

      Manage your weight 

      Both eating patterns and physical activity routines play critical roles in weight management. You can gain weight when you consume more calories than the amount of calories you burn.

      To maintain your weight

      If you are not physically active, work your way up to 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity. This could be dancing or doing yard work. You could meet the goal of 150 minutes a week with 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week, 22 minutes daily, or what works for you.
      People vary greatly in how much physical activity they need for weight management. You may need to be more active than others to reach or maintain a healthy weight.
      To lose weight and keep it off
      You will need a high amount of physical activity unless you also adjust your eating patterns and reduce the amount of calories you're eating and drinking. Healthy eating combined with regular physical activity help you get to—and stay at—a healthy weight.

      Reduce your health risks

     Cardiovascular disease
     Heart disease and stroke are two leading causes of death in the United States. Getting at least 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity can put you at a lower risk for these diseases. You can reduce your risk even further with more physical activity. Regular physical activity can also lower blood pressure and improve your cholesterol levels.

     Strengthen your bones and muscles

     As you age, it's important to protect your bones, joints, and muscles. This can help ensure you're able to do daily activities and be physically active.
     Lifting weights is an example of a muscle-strengthening activity. Muscle strengthening is important for older adults who experience reduced muscle mass and muscle strength with aging. Slowly increasing the amount of weight and number of repetitions as part of muscle-strengthening activities will give you even more benefits, no matter your age.

     Manage chronic health conditions & disabilities

     Regular physical activity can help people manage existing chronic conditions and disabilities. For example, regular physical activity can:
     Reduce pain and improve function, mood, and quality of life for adults with arthritis.
     Help control blood sugar levels and lower risk of heart disease and nerve damage for people with type 2 diabetes.
     Help support daily living activities and independence for people with disabilities.
